### Hi there 👋

Hi,this is @SpecterLLL.

👻 "specter" is the name of an album released by BLU-SWING,more precisely,"spectre".
🎨 I prefer summmoning up images of something unsettled,chilling and creative when it comes to "specter",because the album does convey feelings likewise.

🤸 As for "lll",it is probably the abbreviation of "lalala".You could consider it as a casual,but not random,improvisation.

🎸 A senior student aged 22.

⏲️ It has been 
🌭 3 months since I started using vim to edit files,
🍓 2 months since I started learning C++,
🔪 1 mouth since I decided to pick "software developer" as my career. 

👻 Now my plan is to finish my basic learning on C++ and start my learning on Data Structure and Algorithm.

Everything will be more clear before 2025.
